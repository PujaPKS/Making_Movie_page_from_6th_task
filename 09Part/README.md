One problem with the current website is that when you click on the button Fetch Movies , only then does it get the data.



Watch this playlist to understand useEffect better. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4dunL3FOEk2RkMLDvWanol5zxvMNqe7F. Watch all the 4 videos.



Deliverable [Try it by yourself]

When the user comes to your page, I want you to make an api call and get the data. So that the user can see all the movies without clicking on the Fetch Movies button. [Hint you have to use useffect hook]
Make the code optimised by using memoization and usecallback wherever possible


If stuck for long watch the video 8 from the following link,. But try first by yourself.
