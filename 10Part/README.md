Problem Statement

	Currently there is no way to add new movies from the frontend.

Deliverable

Can you create a form on top of the fetch movie button to Add Movies. Should look like this https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GehkpuXd8BhcP_fmK-D7G_VCIV6Y8NOS/view?usp=sharing
When the user click on the Add Movies button, show all that he has input in the form in the browser by doing console.log(NewMovieObj).
Always keep optimisation in your mind
